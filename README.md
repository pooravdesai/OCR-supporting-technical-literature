# OCR-supporting-technical-literature
The project aims to convert printed documents into digitized format by employing Neural Network based OCR to recognize alphanumeric characters, mathematical symbols, and equations using Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy.

The src directory contains the complete working code of the project. However, the model file which is required in the Identifier module is not included due to its large size.
